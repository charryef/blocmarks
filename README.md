# [Blocmarks](https://cfuller-blocmarks.herokuapp.com/)
**Blocmarks** is my second backend specialization project that I chose for my Full Stack Web Development course at [Bloc](https://www.bloc.io/). It is an application that allows users to bookmark URLs via email, manage and share them with friends.

The app is deployed on Heroku: https://cfuller-blocmarks.herokuapp.com/

The source code is here on Github: https://github.com/charryef/blocmarks
